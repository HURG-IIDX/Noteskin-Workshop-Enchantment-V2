(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!)

Welcome to the noteskin workshop for Enchantment V2! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the "enchantment" noteskin included with ITGmania. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution and/or framerate to reduce file size.

This noteskin was made primarily for ITGMania, but it should work with other versions of modern Stepmania.

For this noteskin to look its best, please set your texture resolution to the highest setting (2048). Some textures use this resolution and will look degraded on lower settings.

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over 400!) including color sets for ITG, Dev, DDR note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins, most of which have several variationss for each color scheme.
There a two sets of variations for each color scheme, half are "Ornate" and the other half are "Plain".

Using the ITG color scheme as an example, there are "Ornate" variations which include the floral pattern similar to the original enchantment:

And there are also "plain" versions with the floral patterns removed for a more simple look:

![Plain](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e695fd3c-ee79-49b0-aa59-a7b87ca6d187)

This noteskin also supports lifts. There are a few options for lifts in both ornate and plain types. Here are the "spectrum" variations as an example

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the Ornate "ITG" Glow set, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a DDR tap explosion), Glow (similar to the default ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). There are Ornate and Plain versions of every set. You can also disable tap explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option. Here is a preview of some of the tap explosion options:

Customization Instructions:

First extract the "Enchantment V2 - Workshop" folder and place it in your Stepmania install in your noteskins>dance folder. This is the noteskin you will be using as a base for customization. Feel free to rename it as this will be something you can make your own!

It is highly recommended you check the "previews" folder and check to see what color options you want, they are in an easily browsable and viewable format.

In the "Customizations" folder you will find the files/assets needed to change different aspects of the noteskin. Each aspect has numerous color options. Within each color folder you will find the asset files needed to change the color of the noteskin aspect. Place those in your Enchantment V2 - Workshop (or whatever you renamed it to if you did) folder and replace the existing files.

NOTE: For arrow customizations, if you are using any of the "RGB" or DDR Vivid" Variations, it is recommended you open the metrics.ini and change the TapNoteAnimationLength=2 to TapNoteAnimationLength=4. The colors may appear to cycle too quickly if left at 2, but you can leave it at 2 if you prefer.

Please note that the customization files for this slightly differ in filename from the enchantment noteskin includeed with ITGMania, so please use the one included in this download for your color customization needs.
