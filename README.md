(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!)

Welcome to the noteskin workshop for Enchantment V2! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the "enchantment" noteskin included with ITGmania. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution and/or framerate to reduce file size.

This noteskin was made primarily for ITGMania, but it should work with other versions of modern Stepmania.

For this noteskin to look its best, please set your texture resolution to the highest setting (2048). Some textures use this resolution and will look degraded on lower settings.

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over 400!) including color sets for ITG, Dev, DDR note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins, most of which have several variationss for each color scheme.
There a two sets of variations for each color scheme, half are "Ornate" and the other half are "Plain".

Using the ITG color scheme as an example, there are "Ornate" variations which include the floral pattern similar to the original enchantment:

And there are also "plain" versions with the floral patterns removed for a more simple look:

This noteskin also supports lifts. There are a few options for lifts in both ornate and plain types. Here are the "spectrum" variations as an example

-----------------------------------Explosions-----------------------------------

Tap explosions can be customized to different match different judgement color sets. By default it comes with the Ornate "ITG" Glow set, but there are options for things like Rainbowmatic and Waterfall and a few others. There is also an "all white" option if you prefer your tap explosions to be color neutral. Tap explosions come in 3 variants per color set: Spark (X shaped like a DDR tap explosion), Glow (similar to the default ITG Cel/Metal noteskin tap explosions) and Minimal (similar to glow but with a smaller area). There are Ornate and Plain versions of every set. You can also disable tap explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option. Here is a preview of some of the tap explosion options:

Hold explosions can be color customized to many different color options and also come in the same 3 variations as tap explosions (Spark, Glow, and Minimal. There are Plain and Ornate versions of every option. By default the skin uses the Ornate "Default" minimal color option. You can also disable hold explosions entirely with the "no explosions" customization option. Here is a preview image of some of the hold explosion options:
