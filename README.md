(Scroll down to the bottom for Customization Instructions!)

Welcome to the noteskin workshop for Enchantment V2! This is a fully customizable "build your own" noteskin suite based on the "enchantment" noteskin included with ITGmania. Just about every aspect of the noteskin can be customized. All customization options have preview images that can be browsed in the "previews" folder. Please note that preview images are almost entirely presented at a lower resolution and /or are compressed to reduce file size.

This noteskin was made primarily for ITGMania, but it should work with other versions of modern Stepmania.

For this noteskin to look its best, please set your texture resolution to the highest setting (2048). Some textures use this resolution and will look degraded on lower settings.

-----------------------------------Arrows-----------------------------------

There are a lot of arrow customization options (over 400!) including color sets for ITG, Dev, DDR note, DDR Vivid, RGB, and other color schemes seen on other various noteskins, most of which have several variationss for each color scheme.
There a two sets of variations for each color scheme. 

Using the ITG color scheme as an example, there are "Ornate" variations which include the floral pattern similar to the original enchantment:

And there are also "plain" versions with the floral patterns removed for a more simple look:
